                To the unsuspecting eye, Nathan F. might look like an ordinary man going about his day. <br>

            </p>
    
            <p>
                There are many theories as to why Nathan's penis is so absurdly huge, but scientists are yet to pull back the fleshy hood on thus mystery. <br>
                Spend some time on the internet, and you'll find some common theories are:
                <ul>
                    <li>&bull;  Nathan was involved in a genetic lab accident</li><br>
                    <li>&bull;  Nathan has hot horse nomad blood coursing through his veins, likely a descendant of the great Genghis Khan</li><br>
                    <li>&bull;  Nathan is not completely human, but some sort of human/horse hybrid creature</li><br>
                </ul>
